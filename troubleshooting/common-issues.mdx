## Common Issues and Solutions

### 1. Something Went Wrong While Triggering Calls

<Warning>
  **Error Message:** "Something went wrong while triggering calls"
</Warning>

#### **Root Cause**
This error occurs when the `time_zone` field is not properly formatted or contains invalid timezone information.

#### **Solution**
Ensure your `time_zone` field uses one of these valid formats:

| ‚úÖ **Correct Format** | ‚ùå **Incorrect Format** |
|----------------------|------------------------|
| `Asia/Kolkata` | `IST` |
| `America/New_York` | `EST` |
| `+05:30` | `+5:30` |
| `-08:00` | `PST` |

#### **How to Fix**
1. **Check your time zone format** in the custom fields
2. **Use IANA timezone names** like `Asia/Kolkata` or `America/New_York`
3. **Use UTC offset format** like `+05:30` or `-08:00`
4. **Avoid abbreviations** like IST, EST, PST

<CodeGroup>
```json Correct Time Zone Examples
{
  "time_zone": "Asia/Kolkata"
}
```

```json Alternative UTC Format
{
  "time_zone": "+05:30"
}
```
</CodeGroup>

### 2. Missing Custom Field Error

<Warning>
  **Error Message:** "Missing custom field but no custom field is showing"
</Warning>

#### **Root Cause**
This error occurs when custom field names contain spaces, which breaks the field recognition system.

#### **The Problem**
Custom fields with spaces in their names cannot be processed by the system:

```
‚ùå Wrong: {First Name}
‚ùå Wrong: {Account Number}
‚ùå Wrong: {Payment Amount}
```

#### **The Solution**
Replace spaces with underscores in all custom field names:

```
‚úÖ Correct: {FirstName}
‚úÖ Correct: {Account_Number}
‚úÖ Correct: {Payment_Amount}
```

#### **Step-by-Step Fix**
1. **Identify fields with spaces** in your prompt
2. **Replace all spaces with underscores**
3. **Update your data source** to match the new field names
4. **Test the updated prompt** before going live

<Tip>
  **Pro Tip:** Use `PascalCase` (`{FirstName}`) throughout your system to avoid confusion.
</Tip>
