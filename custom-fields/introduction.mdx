  **What you'll learn:** How custom fields work as dynamic placeholders that automatically insert personalized information into your AI conversations.
</Info>

## What Are Custom Fields?

Custom fields are like **smart placeholders** that you put inside your AI prompt. Think of them as empty boxes that automatically fill up with specific information about each user when the AI talks to them.

Instead of writing the same script for everyone, custom fields let you create **one prompt that works for thousands of users** by automatically including their personal details.

## How Custom Fields Work üîÑ

Here's the simple process:

1. **You write a prompt** with placeholders like `{FirstName}` and `{AccountNumber}`
2. **The system finds the user** and looks up their information
3. **Custom fields get filled** with real data from your database
4. **AI delivers personalized message** using the actual user information

It's like having a smart template that automatically personalizes itself for each person!

## Why Custom Fields Matter üéØ

### **The Problem Without Custom Fields:**
- Writing separate scripts for every single user
- Manually updating information for each call
- Risk of errors when copying and pasting details
- Time-consuming and inefficient process

### **The Solution With Custom Fields:**
- One prompt works for everyone
- Information updates automatically
- No more copy-paste errors
- Fast, efficient, and accurate

## Basic Custom Field Examples

### **Personal Information Fields**

These are the most commonly used custom fields:

| Field | What It Does | Example Output |
|-------|--------------|----------------|
| `{FirstName}` | Inserts the user's first name | "Hello **John**" |
| `{LastName}` | Inserts the user's last name | "Mr. **Smith**" |
| `{FullName}` | Inserts complete name | "**John Smith**" |

### **Time and Date Fields (default)**

These provide dynamic time information:

| Field | What It Does | Example Output |
|-------|--------------|----------------|
| `{today}` | Current date | "Today is **March 15, 2024**" |
| `{time_zone}` | User's time zone | "Your time zone is **+05:00**" |

<Note> The field `today` should be left blank when trying to make a call either via Agent Call, Campaign Run, Or API. Vodex will fill it automatically using `time_zone` field </Note>

<Warning> The `time_zone` field must be a valid time zone field. The time zone can be **Asia/Kolkata** or **+05:30**. If any other is provided, an unexpected error `Something went wrong` will be thrown  </Warning>


### **Account and Financial Fields**

These are essential for business conversations:

| Field | What It Does | Example Output |
|-------|--------------|----------------|
| `{AccountNumber}` | User's account ID | "Account **12345**" |
| `{AmountDue}` | Outstanding balance | "Balance of **$500.00**" |
| `{DueDate}` | Payment deadline | "Due by **March 30, 2024**" |

## Real-World Example

### **Without Custom Fields (Static Script):**
```
"Hello, this is Alex from Stone & Saunders. I'm calling regarding your account. 
Our records show an outstanding balance. Can we discuss this today?"
```

**Problems:** Generic, impersonal, no specific details

### **With Custom Fields (Dynamic Script):**
```
"Hello {FirstName}, this is Alex from Stone & Saunders. I'm calling regarding 
your account number {AccountNumber}. Our records show an outstanding balance 
of {AmountDue}. Can we discuss this today?"
```

**Benefits:** Personal, specific, professional, engaging

### **What the User Actually Hears:**
```
"Hello John, this is Alex from Stone & Saunders. I'm calling regarding 
your account number 12345. Our records show an outstanding balance 
of $500.00. Can we discuss this today?"
```

## How Custom Fields Make Conversations Better

service. Based on your location in {City}, I think this would be perfect for you."
```

## Important Rules to Remember

### **üö® Critical: No Spaces in Field Names**

Custom fields are **space-sensitive** and must follow strict naming rules:

| ‚úÖ **Correct** | ‚ùå **Wrong** | Why It Matters |
|----------------|---------------|----------------|
| `{FirstName}` | `{First Name}` | Spaces cause errors |
| `{AccountNumber}` | `{Account Number}` | System can't find the field |
| `{AmountDue}` | `{Amount Due}` | Data retrieval fails |

### **‚úÖ Use Underscores Instead of Spaces**

When you need multiple words, connect them with underscores:

```
{Account_Number}    ‚úÖ Correct
{Payment_Amount}    ‚úÖ Correct
{Due_Date}          ‚úÖ Correct
```

## Getting Started with Custom Fields

## Next Steps
