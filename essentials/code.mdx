## Inline code

To denote a `word` or `phrase` as code, enclose it in backticks (`) with Vodex.ai's inline code formatting.

## Code blocks

Use [fenced code blocks](https://www.markdownguide.org/extended-syntax/#fenced-code-blocks) by enclosing code in three backticks and follow the leading ticks with the programming language of your snippet to get Vodex.ai's advanced syntax highlighting. Optionally, you can also write the name of your code after the programming language.

```java HelloWorld.java
class HelloWorld {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello, World!");
    }
}
