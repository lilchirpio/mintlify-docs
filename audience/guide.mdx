<Info>
  **What you'll learn:** How to add people to your calling list (audience) so your AI agents know who to call. This guide covers both manual entry and file upload methods.
</Info>

## What Is an Audience?

Think of an **audience** as your **calling list** - the people you want your AI agents to call. Just like you need a phone book to make calls, your AI agents need an audience list to know who to contact.

## Why Do You Need an Audience?

- **Your AI agents need targets** - They can't call people if they don't know who to call
- **Organize your contacts** - Group people by different campaigns or purposes
- **Track your calling progress** - Know who has been called and who hasn't
- **Manage your calling strategy** - Focus on specific groups of people

## How to Add Your First Audience

### **Step 1: Start Adding an Audience**

1. Go to the **Audience section** in your dashboard
2. Click the **"+ Add New Audience"** button
3. You'll see a form where you can add audience details

### **Step 2: Give Your Audience a Name**

First, you need to identify your audience:

| Field | What to Enter | Example |
|-------|---------------|---------|
| **Audience Name** | A name to identify this group | "Customer Follow-up List" |

<Warning>
  **Important:** Choose a clear, descriptive name for your audience. This helps you organize different calling campaigns and find the right list later.
</Warning>

### **Step 3: Choose How to Add People**

You have **two options** for adding people to your audience:

#### **Option A: Upload a File (Recommended for Large Lists)**

If you have many people to add (like 50+ contacts):

1. **Click "Choose File"** button
2. **Select your Excel file** (.xlsx or .xls format)
3. **Upload the file** to the system
4. **Click "Save"** to create your audience

<Info>
  **File Requirements:** Only Excel files (.xlsx or .xls) are accepted. Make sure your file has columns for FirstName, LastName, and PhoneNum.

1. **Click "Create Manually"** button
2. **Fill in the person's details:**
   - **First Name** - The person's first name
   - **Last Name** - The person's last name  
   - **Phone Number** - Their contact number
3. **Click "Save"** to add this person
4. **To add more people manually:**

   - Fill in their details
   - Click **"Save"** when finished
