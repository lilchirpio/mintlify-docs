# Send SMS, WhatsApp or Email on Call

<Info>
  **What you'll learn:** How to configure automated messaging during AI calls using your own messaging providers to send SMS, WhatsApp messages, and emails with static content.
</Info>

## Overview

The messaging feature allows your AI agent to automatically send messages during calls using your own messaging service providers. This is useful for sending confirmations, appointment details, links, or other important information while the conversation is happening.

<Warning>
  **Important:** These messages are **static/fixed content only**. You must provide your own SMS, WhatsApp, and email service providers through cURL integration.
</Warning>

---

## Configuration Setup

### Messaging Section Location

In every project, you'll find the messaging configuration in the **Messaging Section** with three input fields:

1. **SMS Provider cURL**
2. **WhatsApp Provider cURL** 
3. **Email Provider cURL**

### Provider Requirements

<Card title="Bring Your Own Providers" icon="exclamation-triangle">
  **You must provide:**
  - Your own SMS service provider (Twilio, AWS SNS, etc.)
  - Your own WhatsApp Business API provider
  - Your own email service provider (SendGrid, Mailgun, etc.)
  
  **Vodex does not provide these messaging services - only the integration capability.**
</Card>

## SMS Configuration

### SMS Provider Setup

Configure your SMS provider by entering the complete cURL command in the SMS field.

<CodeGroup>
```bash Example SMS cURL (Twilio)
curl -X POST "https://api.twilio.com/2010-04-01/Accounts/YOUR_ACCOUNT_SID/Messages.json" \
-u "YOUR_ACCOUNT_SID:YOUR_AUTH_TOKEN" \
-d "From=+1234567890" \
-d "To={PhoneNum}" \
-d "Body=Your appointment is confirmed for tomorrow at 10 AM. Please arrive 15 minutes early."
```

```bash Example SMS cURL (AWS SNS)
curl -X POST "https://sns.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/" \
-H "Authorization: AWS4-HMAC-SHA256 Credential=YOUR_ACCESS_KEY/..." \
-H "Content-Type: application/x-amz-json-1.0" \
-H "X-Amz-Target: AmazonSNS.Publish" \
-d '{
  "PhoneNumber": "{PhoneNum}",
  "Message": "Your appointment is confirmed for tomorrow at 10 AM."
}'
```
</CodeGroup>

### SMS Field Mapping

<Tip>
  **Phone Number Field:** Use `{PhoneNum}` as the placeholder for the recipient's phone number in your cURL command.
</Tip>

| Field | Placeholder | Description |
|-------|-------------|-------------|
| **Recipient Phone** | `{PhoneNum}` | Automatically replaced with the caller's phone number |
| **Message Content** | Static text | Fixed message content (cannot be dynamic) |

## WhatsApp Configuration

### WhatsApp Provider Setup

Configure your WhatsApp Business API provider with the complete cURL command.

<CodeGroup>

-H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN" \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{
  "messaging_product": "whatsapp",

## Important Limitations and Warnings

### Email Collection Limitations

<Warning>
  **Email Collection Not Recommended:** Our AI agents can capture emails during calls, but they cannot send emails to those specific captured emails. We strongly advise against collecting emails during calls due to:
  
  - **Accent recognition issues** - Different pronunciations cause errors
  - **Alphabet identification problems** - Spelling out emails is error-prone  
  - **Customer frustration** - Repeated spelling attempts irritate callers
  - **Time consumption** - Email collection significantly extends call duration
</Warning>

### Static Message Limitation

<Warning>
  **Static Messages Only:** All messages (SMS, WhatsApp, Email) are completely static and cannot include dynamic content from the conversation. The message content is fixed at configuration time.
</Warning>

### Provider Responsibility

<Warning>
  **Your Providers Required:** Vodex does not provide SMS, WhatsApp, or email services. You must:
  - Set up your own messaging service accounts
  - Handle provider billing and limits
  - Ensure compliance with provider terms of service
  - Manage delivery rates and failures
</Warning>
