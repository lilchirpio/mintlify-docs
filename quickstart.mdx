## Get started in three steps

Get your Vodex.ai documentation site running locally and make your first customization.

### Step 1: Set up your local environment

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="copy" title="Clone your docs locally">
    During the onboarding process, you created a GitHub repository with your docs content if you didn't already have one. You can find a link to this repository in your [dashboard](https://dashboard.vodex.ai).
    
    To clone the repository locally so that you can make and preview changes to your docs, follow the [Cloning a repository](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository) guide in the GitHub docs.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion icon="rectangle-terminal" title="Start the preview server">
    1. Install the Vodex.ai CLI: `npm i -g mint`
    2. Navigate to your docs directory and run: `mint dev`
    3. Open `http://localhost:3000` to see your docs live!
    
    <Tip>Your preview updates automatically as you edit files with Vodex.ai's real-time preview system.</Tip>
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Step 2: Deploy your changes

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="github" title="Install our GitHub app">
    Install the Vodex.ai GitHub app from your [dashboard](https://dashboard.vodex.ai/settings/organization/github-app).
    
    Our GitHub app automatically deploys your changes to your docs site, so you don't need to manage deployments yourself.
</Accordion>
<Accordion icon="palette" title="Update your site name and colors">
    For a first change, let's update the name and colors of your docs site to match your brand.

    1. Open `docs.json` in your editor.
    2. Change the `"name"` field to your project name.
    3. Update the `"colors"` to match your brand using Vodex.ai's flexible theming system.
    4. Save and see your changes instantly at `http://localhost:3000`.

    <Tip>Try changing the primary color to see an immediate difference with Vodex.ai's instant preview!</Tip>
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Step 3: Go live

<Accordion icon="rocket" title="Publish your docs">
  1. Commit and push your changes.
  2. Your docs will update and be live in moments with Vodex.ai's automatic deployment!
</Accordion>
