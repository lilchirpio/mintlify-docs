## What is Business Verification?

Business Verification is like getting a "phone license" for your company. Just like you need a driver's license to drive a car, your business needs to be verified to use Twilio's phone services.

**Simple explanation:** It's Twilio's way of checking that your business is real and legitimate before letting you make calls or send messages.

## Why Do You Need It?

### üõ°Ô∏è It's Required by Law
Many countries have rules that say businesses must prove who they are before using phone services. This helps prevent scams and fraud.

### üìû Better Call Success
When your business is verified, people are more likely to answer your calls because they know you're a real company.

### üö´ Avoid Getting Blocked
Unverified businesses often get their calls blocked or marked as spam. Verification helps prevent this.
