# SHAKEN/STIR: Call Authentication

## What is SHAKEN/STIR?

SHAKEN/STIR is like a security system for phone calls. It helps make sure that when someone calls you, they are really who they say they are.

**Think of it like:** A security guard at a building who checks everyone's ID before letting them in.

## Breaking Down the Names

### SHAKEN
**Stands for:** Signature-based Handling of Asserted information using toKENs
**What it means:** A system that puts a digital signature on phone calls to prove they're real

### STIR
**Stands for:** Secure Telephony Identity Revisited  
**What it means:** A set of rules for making phone calls secure and trustworthy

**Together:** They work like a team to prevent fake calls and caller ID spoofing.

## The Problem SHAKEN/STIR Solves

### Before SHAKEN/STIR
- Scammers could fake caller ID numbers
- You'd see "Your Bank" calling, but it was actually a scammer
- Millions of fake calls every day
- People lost money to phone scams

### After SHAKEN/STIR
- Every call gets a digital "fingerprint"
- You can see if a call is really from who it says it is
- Scammers can't easily fake caller ID anymore
- Much safer phone system

## How Does It Work?

### Step 1: Making a Call
When someone makes a call:
1. Their phone company checks: "Is this person allowed to use this number?"
2. If yes, they add a digital signature to the call
3. This signature is like a seal that proves the call is legitimate

### Step 2: The Call Travels
As the call goes through different phone companies:
1. Each company checks the signature
2. They make sure it hasn't been tampered with
3. If the signature is valid, they pass the call along

### Step 3: You Receive the Call
When the call reaches you:
1. Your phone company checks the signature one last time
2. If it's valid, the call comes through normally
3. If it's fake or tampered with, the call might be blocked or flagged

## Understanding Attestation Levels

Think of attestation levels like different types of ID verification:

### Level A - Full Attestation (Best)
**What it means:** The phone company knows the caller AND confirms they have the right to use that number
**Like having:** A driver's license with your photo and address
**You can trust:** This call is definitely from who it says it is

### Level B - Partial Attestation (Good)
**What it means:** The phone company knows the caller, but can't confirm they have the right to use that number
**Like having:** A student ID that shows your name but not your address
**You can trust:** The caller is known, but be a little more careful

### Level C - Gateway Attestation (Caution)
**What it means:** The phone company doesn't know who the caller is or if they have the right to use that number
**Like having:** A visitor's badge with just a number
**You should:** Be extra careful with these calls

## What You'll See on Your Phone

### ✅ Verified Calls
- Your phone might show a checkmark or "Verified" label
- The caller ID will be more trustworthy
- You'll know the call is really from who it says

### ⚠️ Unverified Calls
- Your phone might show a warning
- The caller ID might be marked as "Unknown" or "Suspicious"
- You should be more careful about answering

### 🚫 Blocked Calls
- Some fake calls will be blocked completely
- You won't even see them in your call log
- This protects you from scams

## Benefits for Everyone

- **Higher Answer Rates:** People are more likely to answer verified calls
