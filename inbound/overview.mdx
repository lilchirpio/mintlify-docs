## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration Process

### Step 1: Create Reference Call

<Steps>
  <Step title="Set Up Outbound Call">
    **Create Template Call**
    - Create a new outbound call in your project
    - Configure all desired settings (AI model, voice, prompts, etc.)
    - Set up custom fields and insights as needed
    - Test the call to ensure everything works correctly
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Access Dialer Config">
    **Enable Dialer Configuration**
    - Navigate to your project settings
    - Look for "Dialer Config" section
    - **Note:** This section is enabled on request only
    - Contact support if you don't see this option
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Attach Reference Call">
    **Link Call to Inbound**
    - In Dialer Config section, select your test call
    - Click "Attach Call" to link it to inbound routing
    - System will generate a unique SIP URI
    - Save the configuration
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Get SIP URI">
    **Retrieve Connection Details**
    - System displays SIP URI: `sip:xxxxxxxxxx@34.27.110.155:5080`
    - Copy this URI for your dialer/Twilio configuration
    - The `xxxxxxxxxx` is your unique call identifier
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Step 2: Configure Your Dialer

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="üîß Twilio SIP Configuration">
    **Twilio SIP Trunk Setup**
    
    **Origination URI:**
    ```

    ```
    
    **Configuration Steps:**
    1. Login to your Twilio Console
    2. Navigate to Elastic SIP Trunking
    3. Create or edit your SIP Trunk
    4. Add the Vodex SIP URI to Origination settings

## üîí Call Attachment System

### Why Use Call Attachment?

<Warning>
  **Quality Protection:** The call attachment system acts as a locking mechanism to ensure inbound call quality remains consistent even when project settings are being modified.
</Warning>

#### The Problem Without Attachment

<Card title="Uncontrolled Inbound Issues" icon="exclamation-triangle">
  **Potential Problems:**
  - Inbound calls affected by real-time project changes
  - Inconsistent AI behavior during settings updates
  - Quality degradation during agent modifications
  - Unpredictable call outcomes during maintenance
</Card>

#### The Solution: Call Attachment

<Card title="Locked Configuration Benefits" icon="lock">
  **Stability Advantages:**
  - Inbound calls use frozen, tested settings
  - Project modifications don't affect active inbound routing
  - Consistent AI behavior for all incoming calls
  - Quality assurance through configuration locking
</Card>

### How Call Attachment Works

<Steps>
  <Step title="Configuration Snapshot">
    **Settings Capture**
    - When you attach a call, Vodex captures all settings
    - AI prompt, voice settings, model configuration
    - Custom fields, insights, and workflow rules
    - Complete configuration is "frozen" for inbound use
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Isolated Operation">
    **Independent Processing**
    - Inbound calls operate independently from project changes
    - Live project modifications don't affect inbound routing
    - Attached call settings remain stable and consistent
    - Quality is maintained regardless of ongoing work
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Update Process">
    **Changing Inbound Settings**
    - To modify inbound behavior, create a new outbound call
    - Configure the new call with desired changes
    - Test thoroughly before attaching
    - Replace the old attachment with the new call
  </Step>
</Steps>
