description: 'Configure SIP Trunks with various providers (Vonage, Bandwidth, etc.) for Vodex AI integration'
---

<Info>
  **Universal Guide:** This guide covers SIP Trunk configuration for various providers including Vonage, Bandwidth, Flowroute, and other SIP-compatible services to integrate with Vodex AI.
</Info>

Configure SIP Trunks with any SIP provider to route incoming calls to your Vodex AI agents. While each provider has a slightly different interface, the core configuration principles remain the same.

## üéØ Universal SIP Configuration

### Core Vodex Settings

**These settings apply to ALL SIP providers:**

| Setting | Value | Description |
|---------|-------|-------------|
| **SIP Server/Host** | `34.27.110.155` | Vodex AI SIP Gateway |
| **Port** | `5080` | SIP Communication Port |
| **Transport** | `TCP` | Recommended transport protocol |
| **Authentication** | None/IP-based | No username/password required |

### Universal SIP URI Format

```
sip:[identifier]@34.27.110.155:5080;transport=tcp
```

<Warning>
  **Critical:** Replace `[identifier]` with your unique Vodex SIP identifier from your Dialer Config setup. The IP address `34.27.110.155` must be used exactly as shown.
</Warning>
