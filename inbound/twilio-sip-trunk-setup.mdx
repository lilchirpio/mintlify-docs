## üéØ What is a SIP Trunk?

### SIP Trunk Overview

<Card title="SIP Trunk Functionality" icon="network-wired">
  **Communication Bridge**
  
  A SIP Trunk is a virtual connection that enables Voice over IP (VoIP) communication between different systems. In our case, it connects:
  
  - **Twilio's phone system** ‚Üî **Vodex AI platform**
  - **Your phone numbers** ‚Üî **AI agents**
  - **Incoming calls** ‚Üî **Automated responses**

## üõ†Ô∏è Step-by-Step SIP Trunk Creation

### Step 1: Access Twilio Console

<Steps>
  <Step title="Login to Twilio">
    **Navigate to SIP Trunking**
    1. Go to [Twilio Console](https://console.twilio.com)
    2. Login with your Twilio account credentials
    3. Navigate to **Develop** ‚Üí **Elastic SIP Trunking**
    4. Click on **"Trunks"** in the sidebar menu
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Initiate Trunk Creation">
    **Start New Trunk**
    1. Click the **"Create new SIP Trunk"** button
    2. You'll be directed to the trunk configuration page
    3. Prepare to enter your trunk details
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Step 2: Basic Trunk Configuration

<Steps>
  <Step title="Trunk Identification">
    **Name and Description**
    
    **Friendly Name:** `Vodex-AI-Trunk`
    ```
    Recommended naming: Vodex-AI-[Purpose]
    Examples:
    - Vodex-AI-Support
    - Vodex-AI-Sales  
    - Vodex-AI-Main
    ```
    
    **Domain Name:** (Optional - can be left blank)
    ```
    Leave empty unless you have specific requirements
    ```
    
    **Description:** 
    ```
    SIP Trunk for routing calls to Vodex AI agents
    IP: 34.27.110.155
    Purpose: [Your specific use case]
    ```
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Authentication Settings">
    **Security Configuration**
    
    **Authentication:** `None` (Recommended for Vodex integration)
    
    <Info>
      **Why No Authentication:** Vodex AI servers are pre-configured to accept connections from Twilio. Using IP-based authentication simplifies the setup while maintaining security.
    </Info>
    
    **Secure Trunking:** Enable if required by your organization
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Step 3: Origination Configuration

<Steps>
  <Step title="Add Origination URI">
    **Outbound Call Routing**
    1. Click on the **"Origination"** tab
    2. Click **"Add Origination URI"**
    3. Configure the URI pointing to Vodex servers
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Configure Vodex Endpoint">
    **Origination URI Settings**
    
    **URI:** 
    ```
    sip:34.27.110.155:5080;transport=tcp
    ```
    
    **Priority:** `10`
    **Weight:** `10`
    
    <Warning>
      **Important:** Use exactly `34.27.110.155` as the IP address. This is the Vodex AI SIP gateway that will handle your calls.
    </Warning>
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Advanced Origination Settings">
    **Optional Configuration**
    
    **Enabled:** ‚úÖ Checked
    **Friendly Name:** `Vodex-AI-Gateway`
    
    **Additional Parameters:**
    - Leave other settings at default values
    - Ensure the URI is active and enabled
    - Save the origination configuration
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Step 4: Termination Configuration (Optional)

<Steps>
  <Step title="Termination Setup">
    **Inbound Call Handling**
    
    <Info>
      **For Vodex Integration:** Termination configuration is typically not required for basic Vodex AI integration, as calls are primarily routed outbound to Vodex servers.
    </Info>
    
    **If Termination is Required:**
    1. Click on **"Termination"** tab
    2. Add termination URI if needed for your specific setup
    3. Use the same IP: `34.27.110.155:5080`
  </Step>
</Steps>

## üí° Best Practices

### Naming Conventions
```
Recommended Format: Vodex-AI-[Purpose]-[Environment]

Examples:
‚úÖ Vodex-AI-Support-Prod
‚úÖ Vodex-AI-Sales-Test  
‚úÖ Vodex-AI-Main-Dev
‚ùå MyTrunk
‚ùå SIPTrunk1
```

### Security Considerations
- **Monitor Usage:** Regularly check call volumes and patterns
- **Access Control:** Use ACLs if your organization requires IP restrictions
- **Authentication:** Use "None" for Vodex integration unless specific security requirements exist
- **Regular Audits:** Periodically review trunk configurations and usage

### Performance Optimization
- **Multiple Trunks:** Consider separate trunks for different purposes or traffic volumes
- **Load Balancing:** Use weight settings to distribute load across multiple URIs if needed
- **Monitoring:** Enable Twilio Insights for call quality monitoring
- **Documentation:** Keep detailed records of your trunk configurations
