description: 'Step-by-step guide to configure Twilio SIP Trunks for inbound calls handled by Vodex AI agents'
---

<Info>
  **Prerequisites:** This guide assumes you have already completed the Dialer Config setup in your Vodex project and obtained your SIP URI. If you haven't done this yet, please refer to the [Inbound Overview](/inbound/overview) first.
</Info>

Configure your Twilio SIP Trunk to route incoming calls directly to your Vodex AI agents. This setup ensures that any call coming to your Twilio phone number will be automatically answered and handled by your configured AI bot.

---

## üéØ Configuration Overview

When you complete this setup:
- **Incoming calls** to your Twilio phone number ‚Üí **Automatically answered by Vodex AI**
- **No human intervention** required for call handling
- **Consistent AI behavior** using your locked Dialer Config settings
- **Seamless integration** between Twilio and Vodex platforms

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Step-by-Step Twilio Configuration

### Step 1: Complete Dialer Config Setup

<Warning>
  **Required First:** You must complete the Dialer Config setup in your Vodex project before configuring Twilio. This generates the SIP URI needed for the configuration.
</Warning>

**Before proceeding, ensure you have:**
- ‚úÖ Created and tested your reference call in Vodex
- ‚úÖ Attached the call in Dialer Config section
- ‚úÖ Obtained your SIP URI: `sip:xxxxxxxxxx@34.27.110.155:5080`
- ‚úÖ Noted down the `xxxxxxxxxx` identifier from your SIP URI

### Step 2: Access Twilio SIP Trunking

<Steps>
  <Step title="Login to Twilio Console">
    **Navigate to SIP Trunking**
    1. Open your browser and go to [Twilio Console](https://console.twilio.com/us1/develop/sip-trunking/manage/trunks?frameUrl=/console/sip-trunking/trunks)
    2. Login with your Twilio account credentials
    3. Navigate to **Develop** ‚Üí **Elastic SIP Trunking** ‚Üí **Trunks**
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Create New SIP Trunk">
    **Set Up Trunk**
    1. Click **"Create new SIP Trunk"** button
    2. Enter a descriptive name (e.g., "Vodex-AI-Inbound")
    3. Add any relevant description for future reference
    4. Click **"Create"** to proceed
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Step 3: Configure Origination Settings

<Steps>
  <Step title="Access Origination Section">
    **Navigate to Origination**
    1. In your newly created SIP Trunk, click on **"Origination"** tab
    2. This is where you'll configure how Twilio routes incoming calls
    3. Click **"Add Origination URI"** to create a new route
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Configure Origination URI">
    **Enter Vodex SIP Details**
    
    **Origination URI:**
    ```
    sip:+xxxxxxxxxx@34.27.110.155:5080;transport=tcp
    ```
    
    **Configuration Parameters:**
    - **URI:** `sip:+xxxxxxxxxx@34.27.110.155:5080;transport=tcp`
    - **Priority:** `10`
    - **Weight:** `10`
    
    <Warning>
      **Important:** Replace `xxxxxxxxxx` with your actual SIP identifier from the Dialer Config setup. Include the `+` sign before your identifier.
    </Warning>
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Save Configuration">
    **Finalize Setup**
    1. Double-check all parameters are correct
    2. Verify the SIP URI matches your Vodex configuration
    3. Click **"Save Configuration"** or **"Add"** to apply settings
    4. Confirm the origination URI appears in your trunk configuration
  </Step>
</Steps>

## üîß Configuration Details

### SIP URI Format Breakdown

```
sip:+xxxxxxxxxx@34.27.110.155:5080;transport=tcp
```

| Component | Value | Description |
|-----------|-------|-------------|
| **Protocol** | `sip:` | SIP protocol identifier |
| **User** | `+xxxxxxxxxx` | Your unique Vodex SIP identifier (with + prefix) |
| **Host** | `34.27.110.155` | Vodex SIP gateway IP address |
| **Port** | `5080` | SIP communication port |
| **Transport** | `tcp` | Transport protocol for reliable delivery |

### Priority and Weight Settings

| Parameter | Recommended Value | Purpose |
|-----------|------------------|---------|
| **Priority** | `10` | Lower numbers = higher priority |
| **Weight** | `10` | Load balancing weight (higher = more traffic) |

<Info>
  **Settings Explanation:** Priority 10 and Weight 10 are standard values that work well for most configurations. Priority determines route preference (lower numbers get higher priority), while weight handles load distribution among routes with the same priority.
