## üìÖ Enterprise Appointment Management

### Booking Appointments via AI

<Warning>
  **Enterprise Feature:** Appointment booking, canceling, and rescheduling are available exclusively for Enterprise plan customers.
</Warning>

#### Using the (appointment) Tag

To enable appointment booking, use the special `(appointment)` tag in your AI prompt:

<CodeGroup>
```text Example Prompt
"Hello {FirstName}, I'm calling to schedule your consultation. 

If the user gives you a specific time and date to book an appointment, then please say that you are booking an appointment and add (appointment) to your response. The backend will book and confirm the appointment for you.

What day and time works best for you this week?"
```

```text Strict Booking Prompt
"Hello {FirstName}, I'm calling to schedule your consultation.

If the user gives you a specific time and date, say 'I'm booking your appointment now' and add (appointment) to your response. 

You please do not tell anything by yourself, the backend will book the appointment, you just say that you are booking."
```
</CodeGroup>

<Warning>
  **Strict Mode:** For better control, use the strict version that prevents the AI from making promises about appointment details. The backend handles all booking confirmations.
</Warning>

#### Available Appointment Slots

Use the `(slots)` tag to have the AI read available appointment slots:

```text
"Let me check our available slots for you. (slots) 

Which of these times works best for you?"
```

The system will automatically insert available slots from your GHL calendar.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Appointment Configuration

### Customizing Appointment Messages

<Note>
  **Static Configuration:** The fields in the appointment-config page are static. Bots cannot dynamically say "Congratulations, your appointment has been booked on [date] at [time]" - all appointment messaging is pre-configured.
</Note>

#### Accessing Appointment Config

To customize how the AI communicates appointment information:

1. Navigate to: `https://app.vodex.ai/account/project/<project_id>/appointment-config`
2. Replace `<project_id>` with your actual project ID
3. Configure static messages for different appointment scenarios

#### Configuration Options

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="üìù Appointment Messages">
    **Static Message Templates**
    - Booking confirmation message
    - Cancellation confirmation message  
    - Rescheduling confirmation message
