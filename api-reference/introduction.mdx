description: 'Get started with the Vodex.ai API for programmatic access to AI-powered voice calling capabilities'
---


Welcome to the Vodex.ai API documentation. This comprehensive API reference provides programmatic access to Vodex.ai's AI-powered voice calling capabilities, allowing you to integrate intelligent voice automation into your applications and workflows.

<Info>
  **What you'll learn:** How to authenticate with the Vodex.ai API, make your first API calls, and integrate voice calling capabilities into your applications.
</Info>

---

## Base URL

All API requests should be made to the following base URL:

```
https://api.vodex.ai
```

<Note>
  **HTTPS Required:** All API requests must use HTTPS. HTTP requests will be rejected for security reasons.
</Note>

---

## Authentication

The Vodex.ai API uses API key authentication. You'll need two pieces of information to authenticate your requests:

### Required Headers

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Authorization Header">
    **API Key Authentication**
    
    Include your API key in the `Authorization` header of all requests:
    
    ```bash
    Authorization: YOUR_API_KEY
    ```
    
    <Warning>
      **Keep Your API Key Secure:** Never expose your API key in client-side code or public repositories. Store it securely and use environment variables.
    </Warning>
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Database URL Header">
    **Account Identification**
    
    Include your unique account URL in the `dburl` header:
    
    ```bash
    dburl: YOUR_ACCOUNT_URL
    ```
    
    <Info>
      **Account URL Format:** Your account URL is provided when you receive your API credentials and identifies your specific Vodex.ai account.
    </Info>
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### Complete Authentication Example

<CodeGroup>
```bash cURL Example
curl -X GET "https://api.vodex.ai/v1/projects" \
  -H "Authorization: YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "dburl: YOUR_ACCOUNT_URL" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json"
```

```javascript JavaScript/Node.js
const headers = {
  'Authorization': 'YOUR_API_KEY',
  'dburl': 'YOUR_ACCOUNT_URL',
  'Content-Type': 'application/json'
};

fetch('https://api.vodex.ai/v1/projects', {
  method: 'GET',
  headers: headers
})
.then(response => response.json())
.then(data => console.log(data));
```

```python Python
import requests

headers = {
    'Authorization': 'YOUR_API_KEY',
    'dburl': 'YOUR_ACCOUNT_URL',
    'Content-Type': 'application/json'
}

response = requests.get('https://api.vodex.ai/v1/projects', headers=headers)
data = response.json()
```
</CodeGroup>

## Quick Start: Trigger Your First Call

Get started quickly with the most commonly used endpoint - triggering calls:

<Card title="ðŸš€ Call Trigger API" icon="phone" href="/api-reference/call-trigger/run-campaign">
  **Start Making Calls Immediately**
  
  Use the Call Trigger API to programmatically initiate AI-powered calls for your campaigns.
  
  **Quick Access:** `/v1/call-trigger/run-campaign`
</Card>

### Basic Call Trigger Example

<CodeGroup>
```bash cURL - Trigger Campaign
curl -X POST "https://api.vodex.ai/v1/call-trigger/run-campaign" \
  -H "Authorization: YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "dburl: YOUR_ACCOUNT_URL" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "campaignId": "your_campaign_id",
    "audienceId": "your_audience_id"
  }'
```

```javascript JavaScript - Trigger Campaign
const triggerCall = async () => {
  const response = await fetch('https://api.vodex.ai/v1/call-trigger/run-campaign', {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: {
      'Authorization': 'YOUR_API_KEY',
      'dburl': 'YOUR_ACCOUNT_URL',
      'Content-Type': 'application/json'
    },
    body: JSON.stringify({
      campaignId: 'your_campaign_id',
      audienceId: 'your_audience_id'
    })
  });
  
  const result = await response.json();
  console.log('Campaign triggered:', result);
};
```
</CodeGroup>

## Response Format

All API responses follow a consistent JSON format:

### Success Response

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    // Response data here
  },
  "message": "Operation completed successfully"
}
```

### Error Response

```json
{
  "success": false,
  "error": {
    "code": "ERROR_CODE",
    "message": "Human-readable error description"
  }
}
```

### HTTP Status Codes

| Status Code | Meaning | Description |
|-------------|---------|-------------|
| **200** | OK | Request successful |
| **201** | Created | Resource created successfully |
| **400** | Bad Request | Invalid request parameters |
| **401** | Unauthorized | Invalid or missing API key |
| **403** | Forbidden | Insufficient permissions |
| **404** | Not Found | Resource not found |
| **429** | Too Many Requests | Rate limit exceeded |
| **500** | Internal Server Error | Server error occurred |

---

## Rate Limits

The Vodex.ai API implements rate limiting to ensure fair usage and system stability:

<Warning>
  **Rate Limits Apply:** API requests are limited based on your account tier. Contact support if you need higher limits for your use case.
</Warning>

### Rate Limit Headers

All API responses include rate limit information in the headers:

```
X-RateLimit-Limit: 1000
X-RateLimit-Remaining: 999
X-RateLimit-Reset: 1640995200
```

### Best Practices

<Tip>
  **Optimize Your Requests:** Batch operations when possible and implement exponential backoff for retry logic to handle rate limits gracefully.
</Tip>

---

## Common Integration Patterns

### Webhook Integration

Many Vodex.ai API operations support webhooks for real-time notifications:

```json
{
  "webhookUrl": "https://your-domain.com/webhook",
  "events": ["call_completed", "campaign_finished"]
}
```

### Batch Operations

For high-volume operations, use batch endpoints when available:

```json
{
  "batch": true,
  "items": [
    {"phone": "+1234567890", "name": "John Doe"},
    {"phone": "+1234567891", "name": "Jane Smith"}
  ]
}
```
