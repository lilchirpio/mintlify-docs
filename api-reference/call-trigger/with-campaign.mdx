## Campaign-Specific Privacy Considerations

When organizing calls under campaigns, additional privacy considerations apply:

- **Marketing Communications:** Ensure contacts have consented to marketing/promotional calls
- **Campaign Tracking:** Inform contacts that their interactions may be tracked for campaign analytics
- **Data Retention:** Clearly communicate how long campaign data will be retained
- **Unsubscribe Rights:** Provide easy ways for contacts to opt out of future campaign communications
