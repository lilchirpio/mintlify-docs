## Insights Configuration

This endpoint supports **calls with AI-powered insights collection** - automatically gather structured data from conversations using predefined questions.

## Important Consent Requirements

Before collecting insights during calls, you **must** ensure:

- ‚úÖ **Explicit Consent:** All phone numbers have explicitly consented to receive calls
- ‚úÖ **Data Collection Consent:** Contacts have agreed to participate in surveys/data collection
- ‚úÖ **AI Processing Consent:** Contacts understand their responses will be processed by AI
- ‚úÖ **Documentation:** You have documented proof of consent for each contact
- ‚úÖ **Compliance:** You comply with local privacy laws (GDPR, CCPA, etc.)
- ‚úÖ **Opt-out Options:** You provide clear opt-out mechanisms for contacts
- ‚úÖ **Transparency:** Contacts understand what data is being collected and how it will be used

<Note>
  The `consentForCalls` parameter must be set to `true` in your API request to confirm you have obtained proper consent from all contacts for both calling and data collection through insights.
</Note>

## Insights-Specific Privacy Considerations

When collecting AI-powered insights, additional privacy protections are required:

- **Survey Consent:** Contacts must explicitly agree to participate in surveys or data collection
- **AI Processing:** Inform contacts that their responses will be analyzed by AI systems
- **Data Usage:** Clearly explain how collected insights will be used and stored
- **Response Recording:** Notify contacts if their responses will be recorded or transcribed
- **Data Sharing:** Disclose if insights data will be shared with third parties
- **Retention Period:** Specify how long insights data will be retained
- **Access Rights:** Provide contacts with rights to access, modify, or delete their response data

<Tip>
  Consider implementing a double opt-in process for insights collection to ensure clear consent for both the call and the data collection activities.
