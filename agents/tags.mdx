# Understanding AI Prompt Tags

<Info>
  **What you'll learn:** How to use special tags in your AI prompts to automatically trigger actions like ending calls, sending SMS messages, and transferring to live agents.
</Info>

## What Are AI Prompt Tags?

Think of tags as **special instructions** that you hide inside your AI prompt. While the main prompt teaches the AI what to say and how to handle conversations, tags handle what happens **after** the AI finishes speaking.

Tags are like secret commands that tell the backend system: "Hey, do this specific action right now!"

## Why Are Tags Important? üéØ

Tags solve a big problem: **seamless automation**. Instead of writing complicated instructions for every possible scenario, you use simple tags as shortcuts to trigger actions instantly.

### **The Problem Without Tags:**
- AI says goodbye but doesn't know how to end the call
- User needs help but AI doesn't know how to transfer to a human
- Follow-up information needs to be sent but AI doesn't know how

### **The Solution With Tags:**
- AI says goodbye and automatically ends the call
- AI transfers difficult calls to human agents instantly
- AI sends follow-up SMS messages automatically

## How Tags Work üîß

Tags work like this:

1. **AI delivers its message** (what it says to the user)
2. **Tag triggers an action** (what happens behind the scenes)
3. **User gets the result** (call ends, SMS sent, transfer happens)

It's like having a smart assistant who not only talks to people but also knows exactly what to do next without being told twice.

## Common Tags and Their Purposes

### **1. (disconnect) - End the Call**

**What it does:** Immediately ends the call after the AI finishes speaking.

**When to use:** When the conversation is complete and you want to end the call politely.

**Example:**
```
"Thank you for your time today. Have a wonderful day!" (disconnect)
```

**What happens:** AI says goodbye, then the call automatically ends.

---

### **2. (transfer) - Connect to Human Agent**

**What it does:** Moves the call directly to a live human agent.

**When to use:** When the user needs help that only a human can provide, or when the situation is too complex for the AI.

**Example:**
```
"I understand this is complicated. Let me transfer you to a specialist who can better assist you." (transfer)
```

**What happens:** AI explains the transfer, then the call automatically moves to a human agent.

---

### **3. (sms) - Send Follow-up Message**

**What it does:** Sends an automated text message to the user after the call.

**When to use:** When you need to send links, instructions, or confirmation details that the user can reference later.

**Example:**
```
"I've just sent you the application link by text message. You'll receive it in a moment." (sms)
```

**What happens:** AI tells the user about the SMS, then the system automatically sends the text message.

---

### **4. (sms+transfer) - Send SMS and Transfer**

**What it does:** Combines two actions: sends an SMS and then transfers the call to a human agent.

**When to use:** When you want to provide information AND get the user immediate human assistance.

**Example:**
```
"I've sent you the details by text and will now connect you to our specialist who can answer your questions." (sms+transfer)
```

**What happens:** AI sends the SMS, then automatically transfers the call to a human agent.

---

### **5. (sms+disconnect) - Send SMS and End Call**

**What it does:** Sends an SMS message and then politely ends the call.

**When to use:** When you need to provide follow-up information but the conversation is complete.

**Example:**
```
"I've sent the payment link to your phone. Please check it when you have a moment. Thank you for calling!" (sms+disconnect)
```

**What happens:** AI sends the SMS, then automatically ends the call.

## Where to Place Tags in Your Prompts

### **Golden Rule: Place tags AFTER the AI's final spoken words**

Tags should always come at the very end of what you want the AI to say. Think of it like this:

**‚ùå Wrong Placement:**
```
(disconnect) "Thank you for calling. Have a great day!"
```

**‚úÖ Correct Placement:**
```
"Thank you for calling. Have a great day!" (disconnect)
```

### **Why This Matters:**

1. **AI speaks first** - User hears the complete message
2. **Tag triggers action** - Backend system performs the action
3. **Seamless transition** - No awkward pauses or confusion

## Real-World Examples

### **Example 1: Simple Call Ending**

**Scenario:** Lead qualification call where the prospect isn't interested.

**Prompt:**
```
"Thank you for your time today. I understand this isn't the right fit for you right now. 
We'll keep your information on file, and if anything changes, feel free to reach out. 
Have a wonderful day!" (disconnect)
```

**What happens:** AI politely ends the conversation, then the call automatically disconnects.

---

### **Example 2: Transfer with Information**

**Scenario:** Customer needs technical support that requires human assistance.

**Prompt:**
```
"I understand you're experiencing a technical issue. I've sent you a troubleshooting guide 
by text message, and now I'll connect you to our technical support team who can help 
you resolve this immediately." (sms+transfer)
```

**What happens:** AI sends troubleshooting guide via SMS, then transfers the call to technical support.

---

### **Example 3: Follow-up with Call Ending**

**Scenario:** Appointment reminder call where the user confirms they'll attend.

**Prompt:**
```
"Perfect! I've sent you a confirmation email and calendar reminder by text message. 
Your appointment is confirmed for tomorrow at 2 PM. We look forward to seeing you!" (sms+disconnect)
```

**What happens:** AI sends confirmation details via SMS, then ends the call.

## Best Practices for Using Tags

### **‚úÖ Do's**

- **Keep it simple** - Use one tag per action unless combining makes sense
- **Be clear** - Make sure the AI's message explains what's about to happen
- **Test thoroughly** - Verify that tags trigger the correct actions
- **Use consistently** - Apply the same tag patterns across similar scenarios

### **‚ùå Don'ts**

- **Don't overcomplicate** - Avoid using multiple tags unless necessary
- **Don't hide tags** - Make sure the AI's message explains the action
- **Don't forget context** - Ensure the tag matches the user's needs
- **Don't skip testing** - Always verify tags work as expected

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### **Mistake 1: Tag in Wrong Location**

**Problem:** Tag appears before the AI's message.

**Solution:** Always place tags at the end of what you want the AI to say.

---

### **Mistake 2: Unclear User Communication**

**Problem:** AI doesn't explain what action is about to happen.

**Solution:** Make sure the AI clearly tells the user what to expect.

---

### **Mistake 3: Inappropriate Tag Usage**

**Problem:** Using (transfer) for simple questions that AI can handle.

**Solution:** Only use (transfer) when human assistance is truly needed.

## Advanced Tag Strategies

### **Combining Tags Effectively**

Some tags work well together, but don't overdo it:

**Good Combinations:**
- `(sms+transfer)` - Provides information AND human help
- `(sms+disconnect)` - Provides information AND ends call

**Avoid:**
- `(disconnect+transfer)` - These contradict each other
- `(sms+sms)` - Redundant and confusing

### **Context-Aware Tagging**

Choose tags based on the conversation outcome:

| Conversation Result | Recommended Tag | Why |
|---------------------|-----------------|-----|
| **User satisfied, call complete** | `(disconnect)` | Clean ending |
| **User needs human help** | `(transfer)` | Immediate assistance |
| **User needs follow-up info** | `(sms)` | Information delivery |
| **User needs both info and help** | `(sms+transfer)` | Complete solution |

## Testing Your Tags

### **Before Deployment:**

1. **Test each tag individually** - Make sure each one works correctly
2. **Test tag combinations** - Verify that combined tags work as expected
3. **Test user experience** - Ensure the AI's message flows naturally into the action
4. **Test backend integration** - Confirm that actions actually happen

### **Test Scenarios:**

- **Disconnect test:** Does the call end smoothly?
- **Transfer test:** Does the call move to the right agent?
- **SMS test:** Does the message get sent to the correct number?
- **Combination test:** Do multiple actions happen in the right order?

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### **Problem: Tag Not Working**

**Possible Causes:**
- Tag placed in wrong location
- Tag syntax is incorrect
- Backend system not configured properly

**Solution:** Check tag placement and syntax, then verify backend configuration.

---

### **Problem: Wrong Action Triggered**

**Possible Causes:**
- Tag syntax error
- Backend system confusion
- Multiple conflicting tags

**Solution:** Review tag syntax and ensure only one action is intended.

---

### **Problem: User Confusion**

**Possible Causes:**
- AI doesn't explain what's happening
- Action happens too quickly
- Unexpected behavior

**Solution:** Make sure AI clearly explains the action and timing.
