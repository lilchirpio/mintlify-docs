# ✨ Insights (Ask AI)

<Info>
  **What you'll learn:** How to create precise AI-powered questions that automatically analyze your calls and extract valuable business insights from every conversation.
</Info>

<Warning>
  **Critical:** Make your insights questions as **precise as possible**. Don't just ask "if the customer is interested" - ask very specifically what you need to know. Precise questions generate accurate, actionable insights.
</Warning>

## What Are Insights?

Insights are intelligent questions that you feed into the Vodex system. After every call, Vodex's AI automatically generates answers to these questions based on the conversation content, providing you with structured data and valuable business intelligence.

### Key Benefits

- **Automated Analysis:** No manual call review needed
- **Structured Data:** Get consistent, queryable results
- **Business Intelligence:** Track trends, conversion rates, and customer behavior
- **Webhook Integration:** Automatically receive insights via API
- **Campaign Optimization:** Use data to improve future campaigns

## How Insights Work

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create Insights Questions">
    **Before Running Campaigns**
    - Define specific questions you want answered
    - Set up insights at the campaign level
    - Configure via API or dashboard interface
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Run Your Campaign">
    **During Calls**
    - AI listens to the entire conversation
    - Records all relevant information
    - Prepares data for analysis
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="AI Analysis">
    **After Each Call**
    - AI analyzes the complete conversation
    - Answers your predefined questions
    - Generates structured insights data
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Receive Results">
    **Get Your Insights**
    - Access via dashboard
    - Receive via webhook (if configured)
    - Use data for business decisions
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Note>
  **Important:** Insights must be created **before** you run the campaign. You cannot add insights to calls that have already completed.
</Note>

## Insights Configuration

### Three Required Fields

Every insight requires these three components:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Name">
    **Programming Variable**
    
    The technical identifier for your insight, used in webhooks and API responses.
    
    **Rules:**
    - No spaces allowed
    - No dashes allowed  
    - Only underscores for separation
    - Use descriptive, clear names
    
    **Examples:**
    ```
    ✅ customer_interested
    ✅ payment_timeline
    ✅ product_requirements
    ✅ appointment_confirmed
    
    ❌ customer interested (spaces)
    ❌ customer-interested (dashes)
    ❌ interested (too vague)
    ```
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Type">
    **Data Type Selection**
    
    Choose the appropriate data type for your expected answer:
    
    | Type | Use Case | Example Output |
    |------|----------|----------------|
    | **Text** | Open-ended responses | "Customer needs premium features" |
    | **Number** | Numeric values | `30` (days), `5000` (budget) |
    | **True/False** | Yes/no questions | `true`, `false`, `N/A` |
    
    **Selection Guide:**
    - Use **Text** for descriptions, requirements, feedback
    - Use **Number** for quantities, timelines, budgets
    - Use **True/False** for confirmation, agreement, decisions
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Question">
    **AI Analysis Prompt**
    
    The specific question you want the AI to answer about each call.
    
    **Best Practices:**
    - Be extremely specific and detailed
    - Include fallback instructions (return "N/A" if unclear)
    - Define exactly what constitutes a positive/negative response
    - Provide context for edge cases
    
    **Question Quality:**
    ```
    ❌ Poor: "Is the customer interested?"
    ✅ Good: "Did the customer verbally agree that they are going to purchase the product? Return True or False. If the customer does not commit or is unclear, return N/A"
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Advanced Insights Strategies

### Precision Guidelines

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Be Specific About Conditions">
    **Instead of vague questions, define exact conditions:**
    
    ❌ **Vague:** "Is the customer happy?"
    
    ✅ **Specific:** "Did the customer express satisfaction with our service using positive language such as 'great', 'excellent', 'satisfied', or similar positive terms? Return True only for clearly positive feedback, False for negative feedback, and N/A for neutral or unclear responses."
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Handle Edge Cases">
    **Always provide instructions for unclear situations:**
    
    ✅ **Good Example:** "What is the customer's company size? Return the number of employees if mentioned. If they say 'small business' return 10, if 'medium business' return 100, if 'large business' return 500. If no size information is provided, return N/A."
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Define Success Criteria">
    **Be explicit about what constitutes different responses:**
    
    ✅ **Clear Criteria:** "Did the customer agree to a follow-up call? Return True only if they agreed to a specific time or said 'yes' to scheduling. Return False if they declined or said they would call back. Return N/A if follow-up was not discussed."
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Multi-Layered Insights

Create complementary insights that provide deeper analysis:

```
Primary: customer_interested (True/False)
Secondary: interest_level (Number 1-10)
Supporting: objections_mentioned (Text)
Timeline: decision_timeframe (Number - days)
```

## Best Practices

### Question Writing Guidelines

<Tip>
  **Precision is Key:** The more specific your question, the more accurate and useful your insights will be. Take time to craft detailed, unambiguous questions.
</Tip>

| Aspect | Best Practice | Example |
|--------|---------------|---------|
| **Clarity** | Use simple, direct language | "Did the customer confirm..." not "Was there confirmation..." |
| **Specificity** | Define exact conditions | "Return True only if they said 'yes' or 'I agree'" |
| **Fallbacks** | Always include N/A instructions | "If unclear or not discussed, return N/A" |
| **Context** | Provide relevant background | "Based on the sales conversation..." |

### Data Type Selection

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="When to Use Text">
    **Best for:**
    - Customer feedback and comments
    - Product requirements and specifications  
    - Objections and concerns
    - Open-ended responses
    
    **Example:** "What objections did the customer raise about the pricing?"
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="When to Use Number">
    **Best for:**
    - Quantities and amounts
    - Timelines and dates
    - Ratings and scores
    - Measurable values
    
    **Example:** "How many users will be using the system?"
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="When to Use True/False">
    **Best for:**
    - Yes/no decisions
    - Confirmation of actions
    - Binary states
    - Agreement/disagreement
    
    **Example:** "Did the customer agree to the proposed terms?"
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Insights in Webhooks

When you configure post-call insights webhooks, the insights data is included in the `questions` array:

<CodeGroup>
```json Webhook Payload Structure
{
  "call_uuid": "unique-call-id",
  "questions": [
    {"key": "your_insight_name", "value": "extracted_value"},
    {"key": "another_insight", "value": true},
    {"key": "numeric_insight", "value": 45}
  ],
  // ... other call data
}
```

```javascript Processing Insights Data
// Example: Processing webhook data
const insights = webhookData.questions;

insights.forEach(insight => {
  switch(insight.key) {
    case 'customer_interested':
      if (insight.value === true) {
        // Add to hot leads list
        addToHotLeads(webhookData.call_uuid);
      }
      break;
    case 'payment_days':
      if (insight.value !== 'N/A') {
        // Schedule follow-up
        scheduleFollowUp(webhookData.call_uuid, insight.value);
      }
      break;
  }
});
```
</CodeGroup>
