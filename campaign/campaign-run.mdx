  **What you'll learn:** How to control your running campaigns, stop calls when needed, and see all the details about what's happening with your calls.
</Info>

## What Is a Campaign Run?

Think of a **campaign run** like a **live TV show** - it's what happens when your campaign is actually making phone calls right now! 

- **Campaign Run** = Your campaign is actively calling people
- **Running Campaign** = Phone calls are happening right now
- **Campaign Run Details** = All the information about what happened during the calls

## How to Get to the Campaign Run Page

### **Step 1: Find the Redirect Icon**

1. **Look for a small arrow icon** (‚ÜóÔ∏è) in your campaign page
2. **This icon is like a door** that takes you to different places
3. **Click on this redirect icon** when you want to see your running campaigns

<Warning>
  **Important:** The redirect icon looks like a small arrow pointing up and to the right. It's usually located near your campaign information.
</Warning>

### **Step 2: You're Now on the Campaign Run Page!**

After clicking the redirect icon, you'll see the **"Campaign Run"** page. This page shows you:

- **All your running campaigns** (campaigns that are making calls right now)
- **Campaign status** (is it working? is it paused?)
- **Action buttons** (things you can do to control your campaign)

## What You Can Do on the Campaign Run Page

### **üö´ Stop Your Campaign (Stop All Calls)**

Sometimes you need to **stop calling people immediately**. Here's how:

1. **Find your running campaign** in the list
2. **Look for the "Actions" section** (it's like a toolbox with buttons)
3. **Click on "Stop Campaign"** button
4. **All calls will stop immediately** - no more phone calls will be made

<Info>
  **Why stop a campaign?** Maybe you made a mistake, or you want to change something, or you've reached your goal. Stopping is like pressing a big red "STOP" button!
</Info>

### **üëÅÔ∏è View Campaign Details (See What Happened)**

Want to know **exactly what happened** with your calls? Here's how:

1. **Find your campaign** in the list
2. **Look for "View Details"** button
3. **Click on "View Details"**
4. **You'll go to the "Campaign Run Details" page**
